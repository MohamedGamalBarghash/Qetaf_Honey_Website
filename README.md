# QETAF HONEY WEBSITE
This is a project I made as a request of Gamal Barghush to create a honey marketplace website for his honey selling business.

This version is old-school and is on my bucket list for a visual update.

# CONTENTS:
- Main Page: 
  - An `html` file for the page interface.
  - A `css` file for the page styling.
  - A `js` file for the page functionality.

- Shop Page:
  - An `html` file for the page interface.
  - A `css` file for the page styling.
  - A `js` file for the page functionality.
  - A `php` file for the server side functionality

There is also a preview of the product if you click on it:
